# Spark_Internship
This is repo of my projects that I completed in my internship at Spark Foundation.
# Task 1
# Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis
● Objective: Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines

● Stock to analyze and predict - SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)

● Download historical stock prices from finance.yahoo.com

# Task 2
# Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
